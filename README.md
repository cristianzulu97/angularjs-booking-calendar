# angularjs-booking-calendar
AngularJS calendar where you can select range of dates, choose price and mark those dates available. This version is just a good start for making real AngularJS booking calendar for any purpose. It's easy to expand this code with the full CRUD functions and all other functions you need.

Look at the index.html to see how simple it is to use this calendar anywhere on your website.
All magic happens in script.js.
This calendar has simple backend, just for a testing purposes. In dates.php is a simple class that communicates with frontend and json.json that acts as a DB. You'll probably use some DB for your website when using this calendar.

p.s. This project leans on this tutorial https://www.codementor.io/angularjs/tutorial/angularjs-calendar-directives-less-cess-moment-font-awesome
